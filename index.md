## The Mission

To help business owners and companies with their relationship to technology.

## The Vision

A world where companies embrace the usage of open source software, participate in transparent business practices, and demonstrate values of integrity and community above all.

We can make the world a better place, but we have to do it __together.__

## The Game Plan

### Rock Solid Services

I plan to use a combination of Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, and Backblaze for my newest project.

### Software: At the core of it all

Over the years I've switched between many different operating systems and as a result, I've always searched for software that is easy to use across various systems.

Here are some of my favorites that I use all of the time:

| Software Name    | Cross-Platform?  | Quick Descripton |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | 
| Atom             | Win/Mac/Linux    | Text editor with a ton of features        |
| Firefox          | Win/Mac/Linux    | Secondary web browser                     |
| GIMP             | Win/Mac/Linux    | Image editor with amazing abilities       |
| GParted          | Live CD (any)    | Partition and file system management      |
| KeePassXC        | Win/Mac/Linux    | Offline and encrypted password management |
| Syncthing        | Win/Mac/Linux    | File sync between multiple computers, no cloud   |
| Thunderbird      | Win/Mac/Linux    | Email client, supports IMAP, aliases, identities |
| Vivaldi          | Win/Mac/Linux    | Chromium web browser without all the tracking    |
| VLC Media Player | Win/Mac/Linux    | The ultimate media player of all things          |

Here are some Linux-specific items that are not cross-platform, but do have similar alternatives on other operating systems:

| Software Name | Alternate Software | Quick Description |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | 
| Linux Mint    | Ubuntu             | Operating system with Cinnamon window manager        |
| Redshift      | f.lux              | Color and Brightness management based on time of day |
| tcplay        | Truecrypt          | Truecrypt container creation and management          |
